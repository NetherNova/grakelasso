Welcome to the GraKeLasso repository 

This is a simple Python API for training and evaluating graph-regularized linear regression models

It was built to test the ideas of graph kernel regularization - [See our ISWC'15 paper](http://iswc2015.semanticweb.org/program/accepted-papers)

## Version 0.9
Most important features are:

* Loading data and regularization matrices
* Standard Lasso Coordinate-descent implementation
* Modified Coordinate-descent for graph-regularization implementation
* n-fold cross-validation

## Requirements
* Python (>= 2.7)
* NumPy (>= 1.9)
* SciKit-Learn (>=0.15.2)
* Pandas (>=0.15.1)
